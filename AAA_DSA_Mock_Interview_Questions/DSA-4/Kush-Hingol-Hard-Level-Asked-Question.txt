DSA 4-> Hard Level

1.What is Trees and Graphs?
2.What is binary tree?
3.What is balanced and unbalanced trees and graphs?
4.What is inorder, preorder and post order tree traversal?
Provide the output of inorder,preorder and post order for tree [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
5.What is DFS?
6.What is BFS?

7.Memory allocation in BFS and DFS

8. Time complexity of BFS and DFS

9. You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
A leaf node is a node with no children.
