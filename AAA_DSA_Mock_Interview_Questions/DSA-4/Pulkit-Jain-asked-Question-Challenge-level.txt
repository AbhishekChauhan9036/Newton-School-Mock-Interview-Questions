DSA 4-> Challenge Level


1.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
2.
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
